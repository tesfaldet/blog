_This is for my Architecture of Music II class. Part 2 of 3 of the midterm._

Try to imagine what the sonic experience is like without associated meaning.

1. **Do womb sounds take on any associated meaning?**

	The womb is awash with sounds, particularly from the whooshing of blood and
	digestive system, the thumping of the heart, and voices outside of the womb
	that pass through the abdomen and reverberate inside--particularly the lower
	frequencies. These sounds are repeated day-in and day-out to the unborn child
	and over time, the child becomes accustomed to the acoustic characteristics of
	these sounds; forming an association between sound and setting. I believe
	this evaluated conditioning allows the child to associate emotional meaning
	between what they repeatedly hear and the setting in which they hear it. Also,
	I believe that this "orchestra of bodily sounds" institutionalizes rhythmic
	sounds/patterns to the child and teaches it to relate aural rhythm with a
	comfortable and familiar environment.
2. **Does the womb experience suggest anything about the function of music?**

	The womb experience suggests that music is easily recognizable and that its
	rhythmic repetition allows it to function as sort of an anchor tying down a
	moment or setting with a particular sound. The fetus can hear and recognize
	specific speech patterns, intonations, heart beats, and other musical sounds
	while in the womb and so babies after birth will continue to recognize and be
	comforted by particular songs listened to regularly during pregnancy. Music
	can function as a means to introduce the fetus to reality before it is born.
	It can also function as a means to ease the fetus into reality after it is
	born due to its recognition of familiar rhythmic sounds i.e. music--which is
	typically easy to remember because of its structured, repetitive form.
