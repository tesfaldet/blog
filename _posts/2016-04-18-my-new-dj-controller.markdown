Here it is!

![DDJ SB2]({{ site.baseurl }}/media/my-ddj-sb2.jpg)

This is my Pioneer DDJ-SB2. It's the intro controller from their DDJ series. It came with Serato DJ Intro, the DJ software used to mix tracks. As you can see, it's got the typical jog wheels, tempo sliders, crossfader, low/med/hi filters, hi/lo-pass filter knobs, trim pots, FX buttons and knobs, level meters, 4 deck support, and volume sliders.
