#### To do
- Continue working on the CPS231n assignment.

#### Haven't done yet
- Start implementing Q-Learning for the tictactoe learning algorithm
	- A different reinforcement learning approach that uses a neural net
- Start collecting dash cam driving videos for our dataset
	- I have plenty lined up for processing

#### I'd like to do
- Modify the tictactoe learning alg (with Q-Tables) to have the opponent also use a Q-Table

#### Done
- Finished Q2
