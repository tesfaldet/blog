In this post I'll be going through five basic DJ transitions between
two songs that I learned from [this video](https://youtu.be/rIsPx-8-_Is?list=PLAVVAhfEjp2J9xZ1D8oMit-rCg163qEMm).


**The Hip Hop Slam**

So this is the most basic form of DJ mixing that does not involve any sort of fading whatsoever. While playing a track, get your next track ready. At the end of the chorus of your currently playing track, drop the next track on the one. Easy peazy.

**The Break Slam**

In this mix you'll be essentially doing the same thing, but instead you'll be slamming two breakdowns together. When approaching the breakdown of your first track, quickly fade to the breakdown on your second track.

**The End Zone Mix**

The most simple form of _beatmatching_ mix. Before I continue, let me define beatmatching. It's essentially matching the beats of two simultaneously playing tracks. Simple.

Anyways, back to The End Zone Mix. Over here you'll be starting the next track just before the old one ends. Timing it in such a way that the current track ends right when the next one starts its breakdown. No fader work is necessary with this mix. It's recommended to remove all the bass on the downbeat of the next track while it's being introduced.

**The Chorus Blend**

An evolution of The End Zone Mix. Do the same thing, except over the entire chorus of the currently playing track. Keep a loop on the intro of the new track running until sixteen or so counts before the end of the current track. Level the two mixes together (don't forget to remove the bass of the next track). Once the current track ends you bring the bass in on the next track.

**The Loop Roll Mix**

Keep the intro loop running on the next track. Add an additional loop to the currently playing track just before the transition. Continually shorten it until it's a micro drumroll, then remove the loop on the next track and let it run its course. Echo the micro
drumroll and transition out (you can add filter effects too).
