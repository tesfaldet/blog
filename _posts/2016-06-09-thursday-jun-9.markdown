#### To do
- Continue working on improving the accuracy of my neural net (trained from scratch)
    - The neural net is now 9/10-ish layers and I’m having issues with overfitting
- Start working on Part 2 of the assignment
    - Pre-train the neural net with the VGG network

#### Done
- Certainly haven’t started working on Part 2
- Finished, more or less, the bulk of Part 1. I just need to test a couple of different net architectures I was thinking about.
