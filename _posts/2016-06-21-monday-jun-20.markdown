#### To do

- Start going through Adam's tic tac toe RL code and implement a learning algorithm using the Q-Table approach

#### Done
- Watched the first lecture of Stanford's CS231n
	- Contained intro to the history of Computer Vision. The course will be pretty much Computer Vision using neural nets as the model
- Spent a little bit of time going through Adam's tic tac toe RL code
- The group has been tasked by Dr. Derpanis to collect dashcam videos of people driving
	- No timelapse
	- HD videos only
	- No heavy reflections
	- Create a text file with all the URLs
	- No inclement weather
