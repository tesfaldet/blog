#### To do
- Watch lecture 4: backpropagation and neural nets (part 1)
	- Watch the ["Chain Rule and Tree Diagrams"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCr13iTRN7E&app=desktop) video beforehand
- Start implementing Q-Learning for the tictactoe learning algorithm
	- A different reinforcement learning approach that uses a neural net
- Start collecting dash cam driving videos for our dataset
- Download Geoff Hinton's Neural Net [course](https://www.coursera.org/course/neuralnets) videos from Coursera
