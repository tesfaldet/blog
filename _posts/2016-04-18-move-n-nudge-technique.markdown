The **Move N Nudge** technique is quite simple. Here's the preamble. While trying to match the beats of two tracks, one might be playing at a higher tempo than the other and the two tracks may be playing _out of phase_. What this means is that the downbeat of the two tracks are not in alignment.

So what does the **Move N Nudge** accomplish? It brings the two tracks into phase and matches their tempo. How? Let's take a look at the DJ controller below:

Notice those two large wheels? Those are **jog wheels**. Moving it clockwise seeks through the song forwards and moving it counterclockwise seeks through the song backwards. This only applies while having your hand placed on the top of the wheel. Moving the jog wheel by its edge will cause the song to speed up or slow down slightly.

To the sides of the controller there are the tempo sliders which control the speed at which the track plays.

Move N Nudge involves modifying these two parameters between the two tracks such that they play at the same tempo and their beats are aligned.
