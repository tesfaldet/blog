#### To do
- Go over the [Karpathy](http://karpathy.github.io/2016/05/31/rl/) and [Nervana](https://www.nervanasys.com/demystifying-deep-reinforcement-learning/) blog posts on Reinforcement Learning with the reading group
	- Seems like we're skipping the Andrew Ng lectures for today. We'd be on Lecture 17 otherwise.
- Start finishing up the notes for Andrew Ng lectures.
	- Currently on lecture 13. Unsupervised learning!
- Start working on the tic tac toe Q-Learning exercise Adam gave us
	- I may not have time to start on it today since I'm finishing up the Andrew Ng notes. I'll either work on it tomorrow or Monday.

#### Done
- Went through the above readings with the group
- Finished note taking for lecture 13
- Set up Slack bot that posts /r/MachineLearning posts to the #bots channel
	- Forgot to mention that I set up a Slack team for our lab yesterday
