Here are a couple of tips and tricks I found from [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beatmatch/comments/4arehw/how_to_mix_songs_effectively/) Reddit thread.

- Find a 30 minute set done by some of your favorite DJs
- Go to 1001tracklists.com and find that set
- Downloading the individual songs within the set
- Listen to the set while spinning and try to replicate / understand the different transitions the DJs make.


From [/u/LuckyCVT](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beatmatch/comments/4arehw/how_to_mix_songs_effectively/d12zz42): "Also a tip for transitions, if you get it right, mixing into a build up is a great way to add a surprise, again you can do this by making sections of the track stand out or quieten by using the eq, and as a fun effect you should use the beatmash or beatroll on the track exiting the mix, and also you can use a highpass filter on the last 4-8 bars to make the build up on the exiting track have a smoother exit."

Here's one of his mixes:

Another tip I found is to get out of your comfort zone and to mix tracks you normally wouldn't listen to. Finding new music = finding new ways to mix = improvement.
