**Lento** and **Agitato** are tempo markings that describe how a piece of music should be played. Generally, agitato is three times as fast as lento (~144 versus ~50 BPM).

Agitato is Italian for "agitated" and indicates that a piece of music is to be played hastily, in a restless style.

Lento is Italian for "very slow" and indicates that a piece of music is to be played very slowly.
