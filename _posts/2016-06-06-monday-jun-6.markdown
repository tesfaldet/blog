#### To do
- Start working on the neural net [assignment](http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~hays/compvision/proj6/) Dr. Derpanis handed us (due on Friday at midnight)

#### Done
- Read over the assignment (it’s crazy cool!)
- Took notes on what to do for Part 1 on my iPad (I’ll post these later)
    - I’m still not sure how to count the number of free params by looking at a nn architecture drawing (I drew one)
- Set up the neural net on the new VDI machines we have running at the CS department
    - I noticed around a 3x increase in training/validation speed so this should be helpful for decreasing waiting times

#### Want To Do Tomorrow
- Finish Part 1 and Part 2
- Start doing the optional improvements for Part 1
