**Pic**ture your**self** in a **boat** on a **riv**er

With **tang**erine **trees** and **mar**malade **skies**

**Some**body **calls** you, you **an**swer quite **slow**ly

A **girl** with ka**leid**oscope **eyes**

---

**Cell**ophane **flow**ers of **yell**ow and **green**

**Tow**ering **ove**r your **head**

**Look** for the **girl** with the **sun** in her **eyes**

And she's **gone**

---

**Foll**ow her **down** to a **bridge** by a **foun**tain

Where **rock**ing horse **peo**ple eat **marsh**mallow **pies**

**Ever**yone **smiles** as you **drift** past the **flow**ers

That **grow** so in**cred**ibly **high**

---

**News**paper **tax**is ap**pear** on the **shore**

**Wait**ing to **take** you a**way**

**Climb** in the **back** with your **head** in the **clouds**

And you're **gone**

---

**Pic**ture your**self** on a **train** in a **sta**tion

With **Plas**ticine **por**ters with **look**ing-glass **ties**

**Sud**denly **some**one is **there** at the **turn**stile

The **girl** with ka**leid**oscope **eyes**
