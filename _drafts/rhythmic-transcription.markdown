### Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds - The Beatles

**Pic**ture your**self** in a **boat** on a **riv**er

With **tang**erine **trees** and **mar**malade **skies**

**Some**body **calls** you, you **an**swer quite **slow**ly

A **girl** with ka**leid**oscope **eyes**

---

Cellophane flowers of yellow and green

Towering over your head

Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes

And she's gone

---

Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain

Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies

Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers

That grow so incredibly high

---

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore

Waiting to take you away

Climb in the back with your head in the clouds

And you're gone

---

Picture yourself on a train in a station

With Plasticine porters with looking-glass ties

Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile

The girl with kaleidoscope eyes
